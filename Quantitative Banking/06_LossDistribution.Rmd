Program to implement the Andersen-Sidenius-Basu (Risk, 2003) recursion algorithm. 

Note that the probabilities are fixed, i.e. conditional on a given level of factor.

The full blown distribution comes from the integral over all levels of the factor.

```{r}
#INPUTS
w = c(2,1,3,7)  # Loss weights
p = c(0.10, 0.05, 0.03, 0.2) # Loss probabilities

#BASIC SET UP
N = length(w)
maxloss = sum(w)
bucket = seq(0,maxloss)
LP = matrix(0,N,maxloss+1)  # probability grid over losses

#DO FIRST FIRM
LP[1,1] = 1-p[1]
LP[1,w[1]+1] = p[1]

#LOOP OVER REMAINING FIRMS
for (i in 2:N) {
  for (j in 1:(maxloss+1)) {
    LP[i,j] = LP[i-1,j]*(1-p[i]) 
    if (bucket[j]-w[i] >= 0) {
      LP[i,j] = LP[i,j] + LP[i-1,j-w[i]]*p[i]
    } 
  }
}
	
LP = t(LP)
print(LP)
```

```{r}
barplot(LP[,N], names.arg=bucket, xlab='Loss Level', ylab='Probability')
```
